Although these are useful on a Mac, and will be invisible to the user, they show up when you unzip the archive on other operation systems, e.g. MS Windows. There these files are just meaningless garbage. ZipCleaner lets you remove them from the zip archives the Finder creates.</p>			<p>By default, you can remove all resource information by simply dropping the archive on ZipCleaner. As removing resource forks can make files, (mostly older applications, but also some AppleScripts), unusable, ZipCleaner will warn you. You can change this, by changing the preferences.<br>				Sometimes you might only want to remove the .DS_Store files. To do that, drop an archive of ZipCleaner while pressing the option key, (or another modifier key, you set in the preferences.)</p>			<p>You should be able to open zip files in ZipCleaner from the contextual menu &quot;Open With&quot;. Unless you have told ZipCleaner to report the results of its activities, the application will quit when it is done, if you open it by dropping a file on it. It will remain open, if you open ZipCleaner in another way, e.g. by double clicking on its icon in the Finder.</p>			<h3>Talk to me</h3>			<p>If you find any, have some ideas on how to improve ZipCleaner or just want to share some thoughts on it, <a href="mailto:roger_jolly@mac.com">I would love to hear from you</a>.</p>			<h3><b>Legal stuff</b></h3>			<p>Please note, I can&rsquo;t be held responsible for any damage that results from the use of this software.
